The Homework 3 repo consists of the following homework zybook labs:
10.11
10.15
10.17
10.19
11.18
11.22
11.27


P.S. = 10.19 works as the program is supposed to but there were weird formatting issues I got on Zybooks that i did not get while running it in Pycharm. 
Any specific advice on that would be appreciated.
